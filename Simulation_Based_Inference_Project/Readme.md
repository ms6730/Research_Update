# Research Repository

This repository contains ongoing updates related to the research I am currently conducting. It is structured as follows:

## Individual Meetings

This folder includes two versions of presentation slides:
- **Combined Slides**: A single PowerPoint file that compiles all individual meeting slides into one document.
- **Separated Slides**: A folder containing a separate PowerPoint file for each individual meeting.

## Research Results

This section includes:
- **Presentation Slides**: PowerPoint slides presenting the key results of the project.
- **Reports**: Detailed reports explaining crucial concepts in the research.
- **JPEG Results**: A folder containing all visual results saved as JPEG images.
